## Work

I work with children and adults with complex and co-morbid diagnosis and high support needs including autism and profound autism, intellectual disabilities, psychosocial mental health diagnoses, rare conditions like agenesis of the corpus callosum and chromosomal translocations.

I specialise in assessment, management and treatment of high risk behaviours.

I also help with assistance in legal issues relating to guardianship, unscientific and misuse of restrictive practices authorisations, Department of Education, Family Court issues and the NDIS.

## Research

I am currently a PhD student at the Institute of Applied Behaviour Science at Endicott College, USA. My research interests include treatment of high risk maladaptive behaviours, outcome based treatment protocols and developing programs and techniques that help people with disability to access specific medical treatments while working alongside medical practitoners.
