## Abstract

A group contingency is one in which a common consequence (e.g., a reinforcer or a punisher) is contingent on the behavior of one member of a group, the behavior of part of a group, or the behavior of every member in a group. The most commonly used group contingencies in behavior-analytic practice and research include interdependent, independent, and dependent group contingencies. Group contingencies are advantageous for multiple reasons, including their versatility, as they have been demonstrated to be effective across individuals, settings, and behaviors. Additionally, they are efficient as they can facilitate behavior change in multiple individuals at once. Previous literature reviews have supported the use of group contingencies with children; however, there has yet to be a systematic literature review conducted on group contingencies with adults. Because group contingencies have multiple benefits, it is important that a literature review be conducted to assess the evidence of these interventions when implemented with adults. A literature review of studies utilizing group contingencies with adults was conducted. Trends across studies, the efficacy of different group contingencies, clinical implications, and recommendations for future research are provided.
